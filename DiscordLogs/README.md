# Topic-DiscordLogs

Good day, I have finished something small here.

**[DOWNLOAD](https://topic-scripts.tebex.io/package/5069543)**

I know there are already several Discord log scripts. Nevertheless, I present you my free DiscordLog script.

What do I offer?
- Support for questions
- Change requests / ideas are welcome
- bug fixes
- Will be updated
- Log for: Commands | Items | Weapons | Money | Drugs | Resources 
- Create your own log events.

If you want to use the logs: Commands, Items, Weapons, Money you have to make changes in es_extended.
See [es_extended/README.md](https://github.com/TopicElite/readme/tree/main/DiscordLogs/es_extended).

If you want to use the DrugsLog, I offer a template for esx_drugs, otherwise you can find all events in [esx_drugs/README.md](https://github.com/TopicElite/readme/tree/main/DiscordLogs/esx_drugs).

For further questions I am available on my Discord server. 

Bugs or requests are welcome to be reported via my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/TymDT77Fvd)

**Please do not republish this script or sell it on other platforms.**
